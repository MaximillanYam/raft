# Raft 

This is an implementation of the RAFT consensus algorithm in python, it is suppose to serve as a library that can be used to create wrappers over services / applications. One example in mind is to create a database service that is similar to that of Rqlite which is already running the RAFT algorithm. This can be extended onto other services.
